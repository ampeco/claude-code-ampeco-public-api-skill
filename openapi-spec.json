reported by the charge point's EVSE:\n * `available` - When a Connector becomes available for a new user (Operative)\n * `preparing` - When a Connector becomes no longer available for a new user but there is no ongoing Transaction (yet). Typically a Connector is in preparing state when a user presents a tag, inserts a cable or a vehicle occupies the parking bay (Operative)\n * `charging` - When the contactor of a Connector closes, allowing the vehicle to charge (Operative)\n * `suspendedEVSE` - When the EV is connected to the EVSE but the EVSE is not offering energy to the EV, e.g. due to a smart charging restriction, local supply power constraints. (Operative)\n * `suspendedEV` - When the EV is connected to the EVSE and the EVSE is offering energy but the EV is not taking any energy. For example the driver has unlocked the car, and the car has paused charging. (Operative)\n * `finishing` - When a Transaction has stopped at a Connector, but the Connector is not yet available for a new user, e.g. the cable has not been removed or the vehicle has not left the parking bay (Operative)\n * `reserved` - When a EVSE becomes reserved as a result of a Reserve Now command (Operative)\n * `unavailable` - When a EVSE becomes unavailable as the result of a Change Availability command or an event upon which the Charge Point transitions to unavailable at its discretion. Upon receipt of a Change Availability command, the status MAY change immediately or the change MAY be scheduled. When scheduled, the Status Notification shall be send when the availability change becomes effective (Inoperative)\n * `faulted` - When a Charge Point or connector has reported an error and is not available for energy delivery (Inoperative)\n\nWhen hardware status is null, that means that the charge point has not connected yet or has not reported a hardware status for this evse in the past\n"},"errorCode":{"type":"string","nullable":true},"info":{"type":"string","nullable":true},"vendorId":{"type":"string","nullable":true},"vendorErrorCode":{"type":"string","nullable":true}},"required":["notification","chargePointId","timestamp","hardwareStatus"]}}}},"responses":{"202":{"description":"webhook accepted"}}}}},"LocationChangedNotification":{"{$request.body#/callbackUrl}":{"post":{"description":"Location Changed Notification Callback","summary":"Location Changed Notification Callback","parameters":[{"in":"header","name":"X-Signature","description":"SHA256-HMAC signature of the content using the access token","schema":{"type":"string"}},{"in":"header","name":"X-Timestamp","description":"ISO-8601 format timestamp including microseconds in Zulu timezone","schema":{"type":"string"}},{"in":"header","name":"X-Tenant","description":"The tenant ID the notification is associated with","schema":{"type":"string"}}],"requestBody":{"required":true,"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"notification":{"type":"string","enum":["LocationChangedNotification"]},"location":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"integer","readOnly":true},"public_charge_points":{"type":"integer","readOnly":true,"description":"The number of the charge points in that location that are both public and active"},"public_charge_points_ids":{"readOnly":true,"description":"The ids of the charge points in that location that are both public and active","type":"array","items":{"type":"integer"}},"name":{"type":"object","additionalProperties":{"type":"string","nullable":true},"example":{"en":"example","fr":"affaire"},"description":"Locales that have been created and are not provided on an update will be deleted.

Then you will have to redirect to an endpoint and wait for the client to enter his credit card details there. Once he/she is done (and reaches the successURL) you must then issue another call to this endpoint with the transactionID that was returned from the first call to finalize the process and retrieve the newly added payment method data (Step 2).\n\n ## Step 1\n POST with request body, containing `tokenizedType` to determine the type of the method and `bankTransferType` if applicable.\n\n This will create a new request to the payment processor for adding a new payment method. As response you will get the `transactionId` to track the payment method registration process, the `redirectUrl` and `successUrl`, to redirect your user to, along with any other attributes that the payment processor requires for tracking. Just pass those additional parameters to Step 2.\n\n### Example request for tokenizedType = card\nRequest:\n```json\n{\n  \"tokenizedType\": \"card\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example request for tokenizedType = bank_transfer\nRequest:\n```json\n{\n  \"tokenizedType\": \"bank_transfer\",\n  \"bankTransferType\": \"sepa\"\n}\n```\n\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"transactionId\": 1234,\n  \"successUrl\": \"http://example.com/payment-processor/success\",\n  \"redirectUrl\": \"http://example.com/payment-processor/web-form/123abc\",\n  \"additionalProcessorArguments\": \"just pass them all top the step 2\"\n}\n```\n\n ## Step 2\n POST with request body, containing the `transactionId` along with any other attributes, that were in the response of Step 1 (other then the `transactionId`, `successUrl` and `redirectUrl`).\n\n This will finalize the payment method registration and will retrieve the newly added payment method for you. Note that you can also receive the payment methods using the payment methods listing endpoints.\n\n### Example\nRequest:\n```json\n{\n  \"transactionId\": 1234,\n  \"successUrl\": \"http://example.com/payment-processor/success\",\n  \"redirectUrl\": \"http://example.com/payment-processor/web-form/123abc\",\n  \"additionalProcessorArguments\": \"just pass them all top the step 2\"\n}\n```\nResponse for card:\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": 1234,\n    \"name\": \"**** 1111\",\n    \"type\": \"tokenized\",\n    \"tokenizedType\": \"card\",\n    \"issuer\": \"visa\",\n    \"expireYear\": 2026,\n    \"expireMonth\": 5,\n    \"default\": true,\n  }\n}\n```\nResponse for bank transfer:\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": 1234,\n    \"name\": \"**** 1111\",\n    \"type\": \"tokenized\",\n    \"tokenizedType\": \"bank_transfer\",\n    \"bankTransferType\": \"sepa\",\n    \"issuer\": null,\n    \"expireYear\": null,\n    \"expireMonth\": null,\n    \"default\": true,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n # For payment processors with in-app integration\n\n Braintree and Stripe integrations DO NOT count out `redirectUrl` as these processors should have an ip-app integration and therefore the app itself should use the appropriate SDK to complete the credit-card tokenization process with the processor.\n\n## Braintree\nThe first step is not required for braintree as the full integration is done in-app. Step 2 needs to pass the `paymentMethodNonce` so that it can be exchanged for the payment method token.\n\n### Example Step 2\nRequest:\n```json\n{\"paymentMethodNonce\": \"abc123\"}\n```\nResponse for card:\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": 1234,\n    \"name\": \"**** 1111\",\n    \"type\": \"tokenized\",\n    \"tokenizedType\": \"card\",\n    \"issuer\": \"visa\",\n    \"expireYear\": 2026,\n    \"expireMonth\": 5,\n    \"default\": true,\n  }\n}\n```\nResponse for bank transfer:\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": 1234,\n    \"name\": \"**** 1111\",\n    \"type\": \"tokenized\",\n    \"tokenizedType\": \"bank_transfer\",\n    \"bankTransferType\": \"sepa\",\n    \"issuer\": null,\n    \"expireYear\": null,\n    \"expireMonth\": null,\n    \"default\": true,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Stripe\nStep 1 with stripe will initialize a setup intent, that your app should complete.
